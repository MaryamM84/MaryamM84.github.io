here is my site addres
http://402522058.pythonanywhere.com/

<h3>explanation about how to make it</h3>

<br>I used chat GBT and my own knowledge to build this web app. It was very challenging and difficult for me, but in the end I am very satisfied with the results of my work and efforts.ðŸ˜Š

- 
<br>
<br>
- First, I thought about the basic form of my app and decided to have a sidebar, a login and a sign-up, and a section where users can come and post their comments and suggestions on the site.
<br>
<br>
- On the main page, I put the names of the flowers and an animated photo of houseplants that scrolls up
<br>
<br>
- And in each section of flowers, there is an option to select that flower, by clicking on that option and entering the name of your flower, emails will be sent to you from then on, which will help you to maintain it, for example, once every 4 days to You (it's time to water your flower) will be emailed
<br>
<br>
- My site's backend is with Django and I learned a lot about HTML and Django while doing this project.
<br>
<br>
- And finally, I deployed my web app on Python Anywhere site
